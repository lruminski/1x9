when i was a young boy, i used to cheat time.
i would set the time ahead of time, so in the morning even thought the alarm clock would ring at 7:00, i would wake up earlier.
i was only cheating myself.

the primary function of the 1X9 is to control time within the a space, whatever that space may be.
